[StarFM - (StarMade Faction Mechanics) initial features]
- Controlling systems gives a mining bonus + passive resource pool bonus
- System claim is based on how much "Control Power" a faction exerts on the system, this is based on reactor power. Stations will be more important.

Station Overshields:
 - Stations will have special shields based on a new chamber. These shields make the station completely invincible.
 - Each station has its own Siege Time. This is a time that happens every 24 hours and makes the station vulnerable.

Homebase:
 - Factions could still have homebases, but it would half the control power of the system for said faction.

Long-Range Recon System:
 - Mining in a controlled system would alert the owning faction if they had a certain chamber. (hidden by stealth)
 - Fleets could be set to attack enemy/neutral miners.
 - A scanner chamber that allows you to see locations of all nearby ships/stations (2-5 sector radius)
 - Chamber to see exact control power info

[Post-Initial Features]
 - Make ControlPower be based on offensive, defensive, reactor power, and the manufacturing power of all ships and stations in a system.
 - Ships would not be able to jump in or out or through enemy systems unless a warp gate was set up nearby.

[CODE LAYOUT]
Control Power Sweep:
    For `system` in `the galaxy`:
         Map: [FactionId -> ControlPower]
         Get all loaded and unloaded entities.
         For every entity:
                map[factionid] += calc(ControlPower) (Reactor Cap as of now)
                Mark CP to be halfed if `entity` is a homebase

         For the faction with the greatest control power, give them the claim to the system.
         If CP is too low, remove ownership

Siege Mechanics:
    On station pre-damage: If station is not siegable, dont damage.
    Is a station hittable?
      - It needs to have the overshield chamber.
      - It needs to not be during siege time.

    Siege time:
     - On right click of the chamber, popup a UI that allows faction rank 2+ to set the siege time.
     - When the siege time is set, [todo: exploit countermeasure]
